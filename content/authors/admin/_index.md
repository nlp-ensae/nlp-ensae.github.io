# Machine Learning for
# Natural Language Processing 


##  ENSAE 2020  

Natural Language Processing is a field of Artificial Intelligence concerned with processing in a systematic way human languages. It is now a mainstream technology used in a great variety of products like _Voice Assistant_, _Search Engines_, _Recommander systems_... 
This course is an exhaustive introduction to NLP. We will cover the full processing pipeline, from preprocessing and representation learning to supervised task-specific learning.
